Persisting Relations in a Polyglot World
========================================

Hi, my name is Piotr Szotkowski and I was invited by Greg to write a
_Practicing Ruby_ article after he saw my RubyConf 2011 talk _Persisting
Relations Across Time and Space_
([slides](http://persistence-rubyconf-2011.heroku.com),
[video](http://confreaks.net/videos/657)). This is not a one-to-one text
version of that talk; rather, these are some thoughts on the topics of
[polyglot
persistence](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/polyglot-persistence-future)
and modelling relations between objects.

Persistence: Your Objects’ Time Travel
--------------------------------------

_\[…some introductory thoughs on object persistence…\]_

Persistence in Practice
-----------------------

_\[…persisting objects in relational, document, key-value, graph, PStore etc.
databases…\]_

Sweet Relations, How Do They Work?
----------------------------------

_\[…relations between objects are often the crux of our application and the
problem of their persistence is usually overlooked…\]_

_\[…the way relations are ‘canonically’ persisted depends greatly on the type
of the database backend: keys, embedding, graph edges…\]_

_\[…modelling relations as proper domain objects can yield surprising results,
and their persistence can be greatly simplified…\]_

Object Databases
----------------

_\[…possibly solving all of this, but still somewhat in the future…\]_

Not Your Usual Persistence
--------------------------

_\[…Candy/Ambition example of transparent persistence and Ruby-like
querying…\]_

← Models | Persistence →
------------------------

_\[…decoupling models from their persistence altogether – some highlights from
the ‘Decoupling Persistence (Like There’s Some Tomorrow)’ talk…\]_
